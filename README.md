# PDF Question Answering with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
# 

This repo consists of an app that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by embedding PDF text into vector space using sentence-transformers, indexing it with FAISS, and retrieving the most relevant chunks for a user's question. A transformer QA model (distilBERT) then generates the answer based on the retrieved context.

You can Access the application by clicking the link here: [Application](https://simplepdfbot.streamlit.app/)

! Please Note that, the site might take a while to load and you may need to get the app back up in Streamlit. Thank You!
